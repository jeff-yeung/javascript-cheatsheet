# Interesting Algorithms to Solve Common Problems
There's a lot of problems in the world. Some is due to current events, daily inconveniences (that damn ketchup bottle), ones in power (MAKE MURICA GREAAAT!!!) and much more.
However there's a lot of cool algorithms designed to solve issues in faster (Time Complexity), and less memory-intensive (Space complexity). Although both are important, nowadays space being
cheap and abundant, it is more important to focus on having better Time Complexity. On the other hand, it may be argued that computing power has been made cheaper and inexpensive to 
memory but I disgress. The main focus is on cool algorithms with really smart and clever ways to be faster and to be more space-efficient. Some are feasible and is implemented by large companies
such as Google, Netflix, Apple, Amazon and more etc while others are best left as theoretical ramblings of a mad genius. Although possibly in the future we may see these being implemented when
computing power exponentially increases or memory becomes even more abundant. Time will tell.
