# Path to Learning Programming
It seems that learning how to program is different from CS. CS is the study of computers and it's more theoretical. It is interesting but not essential for getting a job right now.
I want a job in Sotftware Dev specifically Web Development both front-end and back-end. I prefer front-end more but I want to be competent in both.

### (Optional) [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming)
All of these resouces show all the subjects of Computer Science.
However, as of this moment I am not too sure this would help me that much. I do want to learn CS but this does not prepare me for the job or for programming interviews.

[SICP](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml) is preferred but an easier book is [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/)

## 0. Learning Computer Science
1. This might be a good intro to programming [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/syllabus/)
<strong>(Already Know this)</strong>

## 1. Preparing for the Coding Interview
3 major steps in preparing for the Coding Interview

1. Prepare a portfolio that makes recruiters want to interview you. It shows your skills and technical knowledge.

    1. Do projects and show it on the portfolio page
    2. Record what courses you took and document knowledge acquired
        1. This cheatsheet might be helpful in taking notes and everything that I need

Practice Coding Questions [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript)
1. Start doing easy problems on Leetcode to get up to speed [LeetCode - Easy](https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/?difficulty=Easy)
    * After you get comfortable start doing medium questions and hard questions
2. Read through problems and solutions, however these solutions are all in Java [Elements of Programming Interview](http://120.107.155.180/download/%E7%89%A9%E4%BB%B6%E5%B0%8E%E5%90%91%E7%A8%8B%E5%BC%8F%E8%A8%AD%E8%A8%88/J2SE/Elements%20of%20Programming%20Interviews%20in%20Java_The%20Insiders'%20Guide.pdf)
3. Another website of DSA problems [Techie Delight](https://www.techiedelight.com/list-of-problems/)


### Resources for understanding coding interview process
I think article is pretty good too for getting an understanding of what we dont know.
[10 interview questions](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-interview-questions-every-javascript-developer-should-know-6fa6bdf5ad95)

At a point where I am confident in solving coding questions, I can start mock interview prep [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/)

3. Migrate Breeze to React
    1. Add feature to select dates and retrieve historical weather dates
    2. Use GraphQL to get API request

4. Possible Project Ideas
    Prayer journal instead of a prayer request app? I'm pretty sure theres a lot of prayer journal apps out there already
    1. Prayer Request App - Centralized website of prayer request for a group or an individuals
        * Share prayer request as a link
        * View all your friends or starred lists of prayer request
        * Prayer Request list have comments or parts where you can answer
        * Search for prayer request for peoples needs and such
    2. Webnovel Platform - Centralized website where people can post web novels and viewers can read them, donate to authors and participate in chat
        * Read novels platform that is simple, easy to navigate and fast
        * Authors can post novels and have people subscribe or donate to read and such
        * Have account management and authentication
        * Have proper payment transaction security
    3.
