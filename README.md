# Path to Learning Programming
It seems that learning how to program is different from CS. CS is the study of computers and it's more theoretical. It is interesting but not essential for getting a job right now.
I want a job in Sotftware Dev specifically Web Development both front-end and back-end. I prefer front-end more but I want to be competent in both.

### (Optional) [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming)
All of these resouces show all the subjects of Computer Science.
However, as of this moment I am not too sure this would help me that much. I do want to learn CS but this does not prepare me for the job or for programming interviews.

[SICP](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml) is preferred but an easier book is [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/)

## 0. Learning Computer Science
1. This might be a good intro to programming [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/syllabus/)
<strong>(Already Know this)</strong>

## 1. Preparing for the Coding Interview
3 major steps in preparing for the Coding Interview

1. Prepare a portfolio that makes recruiters want to interview you. It shows your skills and technical knowledge.

    1. Do projects and show it on the portfolio page
    2. Record what courses you took and document knowledge acquired
        1. This cheatsheet might be helpful in taking notes and everything that I need

Practice Coding Questions [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript)
1. Start doing easy problems on Leetcode to get up to speed [LeetCode - Easy](https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/?difficulty=Easy)
    * After you get comfortable start doing medium questions and hard questions
2. Read through problems and solutions, however these solutions are all in Java [Elements of Programming Interview](http://120.107.155.180/download/%E7%89%A9%E4%BB%B6%E5%B0%8E%E5%90%91%E7%A8%8B%E5%BC%8F%E8%A8%AD%E8%A8%88/J2SE/Elements%20of%20Programming%20Interviews%20in%20Java_The%20Insiders'%20Guide.pdf)
3. Another website of DSA problems [Techie Delight](https://www.techiedelight.com/list-of-problems/)


### Resources for understanding coding interview process
I think article is pretty good too for getting an understanding of what we dont know.
[10 interview questions](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-interview-questions-every-javascript-developer-should-know-6fa6bdf5ad95)

At a point where I am confident in solving coding questions, I can start mock interview prep [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/)

## 2. Learning Web Devlopment

There's so many resources and guides to this but essentially it boils down to these two many categories.

1. Front-end
    1. Html & CSS
    2. Javascript - This website contails all the needed content [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)
        1. Javascript Basics
        2. Advanced Javascript
            1. [Mozilla resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain)
            2. [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)
            3. [Javascript in 30 days](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30DaysOfJavaScript)
    3. Learning React & Redux
        1. React Official Docs[reactjs](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
        2. Better Explanation [react.express](http://www.react.express/)


    4. GatsbyJS is also a great way to learn react

2. Back-end
    1. NodeJS & Express
        1. Finish the part in TOP first
    2. Databases [Popularity](https://scalegrid.io/blog/2019-database-trends-sql-vs-nosql-top-databases-single-vs-multiple-database-use/)
        1. SQL - PostgreSQL
        2. NoSQL - MongoDB


These courses actually look great [rithmschool](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses#jsfundamentals)

3. Data Structures & Algorithms
    1. There seems to be a good basic course [rithm course](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/javascript-computer-science-fundamentals)
    2. Algorithms split up into two very highly rated courses from Princeton
        1. Algorithms Part 1 [4.8/5](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
        2. Algorithms Part 2 [4.9/5](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)
        3. Want to learn more theres a whole coursera [specialization](https://ww.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

4. Other stuff
    1. Cryptography [4.8](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto#syllabus)
    2. [Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)
        1. ML guide for [WebDev](https://www.robinwieruch.de/machine-learning-javascript-web-developers)
