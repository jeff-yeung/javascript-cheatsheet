Cheatsheet on Javascript

## OOP vs Functional programming
Object Oriented Programming - programming paradigm that focuses on three aspects
<ol>
  <li> Encapsulation - Hiding implementation details from outside to prevent improper changes to private data. ex) Black box with known inputs and outputs
  <li> Inheritance - Child classes derives attributes and methods from parent classes. Child classes may have uniqure attributes apart from parent class. This is the same as JS Object Prototypes. All JS objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype. ex) I inherit my big butt genes from my parents
   <li> Polymorphism - Objects can take on multiple forms. Methods that might belong to one class might be overridden with a diffrent implementation. This includes function/operator overloading and overriding. ex) A man can be a father, a husband, an employee and a Joker
</ol>
Functional Programming - a programming paradigm that focuses on pure functions
<ol>
  <li> Pure functions - functions where return values are only determined by input values without observable side effects
  <li> Function composition
  <li> No shared state
  <li> No side-effects
  <li> Immutable data
</ol>
