# BackTracking

Backtracking is a method to solve problems by making *a series of choices that we can* **return** or **backtrack**.

ex) Losing your keys and backtracking your steps

Seems similar to dynamic programming but dynamic programming searches for the most optimal solution. Backtracking is when you want to get all solutions.

BackTracking - DFS => depth wise
Branch and Bound - BFS => level wise

## 3 keys to Backtracking

1. Our Choice
2. Our Constraints
3. Our Goal
